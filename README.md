# image_classify_retina
Binary classification of retina images using CNN (Keras).

The dataset is balanced. There are 24000 images in each of the two classes. Out of these 75% are used for training and 6000 are used for testing. A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) configuration is used.

The left side panel compares a normal retina image to abnormal retina image. The right side panel compares three images of each class. Clearly the abnormal images have perforations which distinguishes it from the normal retina images.
